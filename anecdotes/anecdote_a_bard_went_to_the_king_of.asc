a bard went to the king of bandits and  sang him a compliment he had composed. 
he bid his clothes be taken off him. the poor man was walking all naked in the cold. dogs went after him; 
he bent over to pick a piece of rock to  repel them, but the  ground was all in ice .he was totally desperate.
 
``only utter bastards,'' he shouted
``fasten rocks and loosen dogs !''


hearing this, the bandit king could not help laughing   . 

``ask me for something, wise -man .''
he said   .


``I ask for my clothes''  said the bard ``if you please .''

_I won't count on you for help / not harming me is all your help ._ +
the bandit lord     pitied him and gave his clothes back, adding a furcoat and a cloak and some coins.
