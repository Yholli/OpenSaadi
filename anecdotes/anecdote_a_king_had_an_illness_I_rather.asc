a king had an illness I rather not recount; 
a group of   Greek physicians had reached the consensus that it had no remedy except for a specific part of the liver of a 
human being endowed with several traits .the king bid such a human being be looked for.
they found a farmer boy with the exact traits the physicians had said.the king called for his parents , 
winning their consent with  amountless gold   ,
and the judge declared it legal to shed a commoner's blood for the sake of king's health . 
as the hangman closed in ,  the -boy turned his head towards the sky and  began  to laugh .

``whence is this laughing from?"
asked the king   .


``parents love their child even if no one else does'' answered the boy , 
``and judges are the ones you can take your complaints to, and the king is the one  you  ask for justice ; 
now, my parent have sold my blood for gold, and the judge himself has legalized my killing , 
and the king sees his health in my death . Who but god can tell such a joke, or else help me with it  ?''


_who should I complain of  what you do ?/I bring my case   back to you   ._

this  stirred the king's heart and brought            tears to his eyes:<div class = "qn"> <span class =  "q"      >
``I had better die   ,''
he said, ``
than shed the of such an innocent. ''

he then kissed the boy on the head and eyes, and set him free, giving him amountless gold , and as I have heard   , the king was  healed the same week   .

_two lines I  still hear in  my head:_ + 
_those who carelessly step on ants_ + 
_are stepped on by careless elephants ._
