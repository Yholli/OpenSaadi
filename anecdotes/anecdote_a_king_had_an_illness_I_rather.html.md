a king had an illness I rather not recount; a group of   Greek physicians had reached the consensus that it had no other remedy except for a specific part of the liver of a human being endowed with several traits .the king bid such a human being be looked for.they found a farmer boy with the exact traits the physicians had said.the king called for his parents , winning their consent with  amountless wealth   ,and the judge declared it legal to shed a commoner's blood for the sake of king's health . as the hangman closed in ,            the -boy turned his head towards the sky and  began  to laugh . <div class = "qn"> <span class =  "q"      >
where is this laughing from?"</span> </div>
asked the king   .  <div class = "qn"><span class =  "q"      >
parents love their child even if no one else does   ,</span> 
 answered the boy , <span class =  "q"      >
and judges are the ones you can take your complaints to, and the king is the one  you  ask for rights ; now, my parent have sold my blood for gold, and the judge    himself has legalized my killing , and the king sees his health in my death . Who but god can tell such a joke, or else help me with it  ? <div class = "verse">
 who should I complain of  what you do ?/I bring my case   back to you   .</div>
</span> 
</div>
   this  stirred the king's heart and brought            tears to his eyes:<div class = "qn"> <span class =  "q"      >
I had better die   ,</span> 
 he said, <span class =  "q"      >
than shed the of such an innocent. "   </span> </div>
 he then kissed the boy on the head and eyes, and set him free, giving him amounless gold , and as I have heard   , the king was  healed the same week   . <div class = "verse">
 an elephant keeper by river Nile said/two lines I  still hear in  my head:/ "those who carelessly step on ants / are stepped on by careless elephants ."</div>
